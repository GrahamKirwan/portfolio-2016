Each individual or pair should pick one or <br />two photos which they find particularly interesting or which raise important questions or issues for <br />them. </div></div><br />Participants then form small groups (of for example 4 or 6) and explain their choice to each other. <br />Each small group then selects one or two photos from the group and explains their choice to the <br />larger group. Each group does this in turn. </div></div><br />This activity can be used to make a list of issues or questions that might need further study and <br />discussion. </div></body></html>
