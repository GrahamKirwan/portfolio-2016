If this is not possible, the questions can be written on a <br />separate piece of paper. </div></div><br />Invite them to write as many questions as they can about the photo. Questions can be directly <br />relevant to the photo or to issues raised by the photo. Encourage the group to ask questions that <br />raise broader issues and challenges. </div></div><br />The questioning process around each photo can then be displayed and shared with the larger group. </div><br />Activities 2,3,4 and 5 are referenced from: <br />https://developmenteducation.ie/feature/doing-development-education-ideas-and-resources-a-starter-guide/using-photographs-and-photopacks/ </div></body></html>
