They are an excellent stimulus because they can stimulate individuals, <br />small or larger groups and photographs can be used to encourage people to talk, explore, compare, <br />debate, discuss and apply ideas and understandings. They can be used to explore how images are <br />constructed, what choices and issues face photographers, how images can ‘lie’ or provide ‘partial’ <br />understanding of, and access to issues. Some questions to consider: </div></div><br />• What do I see and think? <br />• What do I see in an image? <br />• What key ideas or key words does the image suggest to me? <br />• What might the people in the image be thinking? <br />• How do I interpret the image? <br />• What does it make me think/feel? <br />• How do others see the same image? <br />• What do they see? <br />• What similarities or differences do they see in the image(s)? <br />• Are our reactions different? <br />• How would others from different places see the same images? </div></body></html>
