The participants are refugees and <br />migrants living in Ireland. They all decided to capture <br />different moments in order to highlight their unique <br />experiences. Based on the premise that photography <br />can be seen as a tool for emancipation, the <br />productions portrayed in this resource aim to reflect <br />the experience of settling in a new country. <br />Development Perspectives would like to invite anyone <br />accessing this resource to appreciate the stories and <br />messages behind the pictures. </div></body></html>
