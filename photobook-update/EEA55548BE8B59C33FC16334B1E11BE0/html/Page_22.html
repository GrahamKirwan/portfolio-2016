In this way, the entire set of <br />photos can be displayed and described. </div></div><br />Invite the whole group to look at all the posters and share agreements or disagreements on the <br />words chosen to describe particular photos. </div></div><br />The overall list of keywords could be used to initiate a discussion on our images of development or <br />rights etc. </div></body></html>
